Scrapy

Fetch tags from url like this

https://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.1906.html

for as many drugs as possible. 
Desired schema would be
 scrapped_info ={
            'name' : chem["name"],
            'chem_id' : chem["chem_id"],
            'smiles' : chem["smiles"],
            'molecular_formula' : chem["mol_formula"],
            'synonyms' : chem["synonyms"],
            'tags':chem["tags"]
        }

Tags will act as a new node in Neo4J with a relationship to the Drug node based
on name
